#### Requirements
I want to be able to encrypt a string using letter-number substitution according to this [table of values](https://gist.github.com/dearshrewdwit/691c71616995ad2430ab309aa9998745)
```
"E" -> "32"
"d" -> "5"
"Ed" -> "325"
"Hi, Ed!" -> "351078132554"
```

Use your best judgment with your pair partner. If you want clarification, ask your coach.
