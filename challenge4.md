-What is a first-class function?

A function - i.e. a data-type that runs code based on particular inputs - which can be treated and manipulated like a first-order object, such as a variable. For example, it can be used as input for another function, or it can hold its own properties.

-How does the concept of first-order functions apply in JS?

In JS, all functions are first-order objects. This (in my limited so-far experience!) gives great flexibility to the language, since once can easily abstract upon abstraction, creating functions of functions and so on - it reminds me of the flavour of studying Banach spaces, where a functional can be considered as a vector in an infinite-dimensional space.

-What is the difference between declaring a function and calling it?

When you declare a function, you call it into being, define it, store it as an object in the memory. When you call a function, you give it a specific (perhaps empty) input and run the code that the function is built to execute.
