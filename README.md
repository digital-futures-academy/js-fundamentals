# Cipher

Initialize a Node.js project

```javascript
npm init -y
```

Install the cipher package

```javascript
npm i ciphery-mickeymarse-js_challenges-digital_futures
```

In your `index.js` file:

```javascript
import cipher from 'ciphery-mickeymarse-js_challenges-digital_futures';
cipher();
```

Run the `cipher` command followed by the appropriate flags:
`ll` - LetterLetterCipher
`ln` - LetterNumberCipher
`enc` - encryption
`dec` - decryption
`example.txt`/`example.txt.enc` - file to encrypt/decrypt
`key`(number) - number you want to pass for the `ln` encryption/decryption

###### Lost the error handling during a refactoring and currently too tired and too close to the application deadline to implement it.

###### Hopefully, I will be able to do it after handing in my application.
