#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation

# What are first class functions?

A first class function is one which is treated as a first-class citizen, and so supports all of the operations that can be performed on other entities.
This means that the object in question can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument, or returned from a function and stored in data structures among others.

# How does this concept applie to JS

As first class functions occur in JavaScript, we can treat any function as a value of any other object.

# What is the difference between declaring a function and calling it?

Declaring a function is when you define the contents of the function and what code will be run when the function is called.  
Calling a function causes the code within the function to be run and the determined value to be returned.
