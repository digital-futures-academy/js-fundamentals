A first class function is a function that can be treated like any other variable. In
javascript a first class function is treated as a first class citizen which means that
it is another type of object.
This means that a first class functions support all the operations which are allowed to other javacript objects.
Therefore a first class function in javascript can:

Can be stored as a value in a variable
Can be returned by another function
Can be passed as a function's argument
Can be stored in an array, stack, or queue
Can have its own properties and methods.

A function declaration, defines a function with sometimes specified paramaters without executing it.
A function call, executes a function whilst sometimes providing arguments with it.
