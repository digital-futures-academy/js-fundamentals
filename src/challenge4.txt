In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation

First Class function are when functions handled in the same manner as other variables. For example, they can be passed as arguments to a function, stored inside a variable, array or object as well as being returned from a function. 
This concept applies to JS as it links closely with high order functions. As first class functions can be used in many forms, it makes it a useful function in javascript.
Declaring a function is the process of creating your function method where as calling a function is simply using the function already created and running the function. For example, if you create a function getShoppingList with a parameter items, you can call your function at any point to see the items in your array.
