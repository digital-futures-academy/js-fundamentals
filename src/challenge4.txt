#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation

###Answers

Generally speaking, First Class functions are treated like any other variables.

In JS, First Class functions are just a value and another type of variables. For instamce, the following codes show how a function is stored as a variable in JS:

const add = (a,b) => {
    return a + b;
}

Declaring a function means that we create a function and specify what input that function takes and what output we can expect from the function. Calling a function means actually use a function which has alredy been created. 

For instance, the following lines would declare a function that takes a name as an input and return a greeting using that name.

const greet = (name) => {
    console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
}

In order to actually use this function, we can use the following codes:

greet("Elizabeth");

By doing so, the function greet will take "Elizabeth" as the input and return "Hi, Elizabeth!".
