1. What are 'first class' functions? 

'First Class' functions are functions that can be treated as variables. 

2. How do 'first class' functions apply in js?

In the context of js, they can be passed into functions as arguments. They can also have methods and properties like any other object in the JavaScript language.

Example.
const greet = name => "Hello," + " " + name + "!";
Our 'greet' function has a length property.
greet.length;
We can also convert it to a string.
greet.toString();

3. Declaring vs Calling

The difference between declaring a function and calling it is the difference between creating the function and running the function.
When you declare a function, you populate the contents of the function body with code and define how that function behaves in doing so.
When you call a function, you run the code inside the function body. 

Example.
// A greet function is declared.
const greet = name => "Hello," + " " + name + "!";
// The greet function is called.
greet(name);
