 In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or`challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
    - what`First Class` functions are
        - how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
    - Bonus: give examples for each explanation


First class functions are functions that can :-

1. Be assigned to variables.
   
    const greeting = () => {
        return "Hello";
    };

2. Be passed as arguments to other functions.

    const greetings = (greet, person) => {
        return greet() + " " + person;
    };

3. Be returned from other functions.

    const greetfunc = saygreeting => {
        return person => {
            return saygreeting + " " + person;
        }
    };

    Difference between declaring a function and calling it.
    
    Declaring a function means to write the code and save it to a variable so it can be used once it has been called.

    Calling a function means to run the code block of that particular function.
