- what `First Class` functions are?

First Class functions are functions that are simply values that are treated just like a variable. They can be stored in variables, they can be passed as arguments to other functions, they can return functions from other functionsa and methods can be called on them.

Example:

const foo = function() {
   console.log("foobar");
}
foo(); 



- how this concept applies in JS?

They are used in Higher Order Functions which are functions that can receive another function as an argument, that returns a new function or do both. Withut First Class Functions Higher Order Functions could not be possible.

Example:

function sayHie() {
   return "Hie, ";
}
function greeting(hieMessage, name) {
  console.log(hieMessage() + name);
}

greeting(sayHie, "Christine!");



- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it?

A function declaration is more like a function that defines a function with the specified parameters and just sits there doing nothing where as a function call is when you command the JavaScript interpreter to run the code that is written in that function.

Example:
Declaration:

function greet(firstName) {
    return `Hi, ${firstName}!`;
}

Function Call:

greet('Christine');
