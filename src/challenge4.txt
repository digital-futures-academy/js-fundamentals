First class functions occur when a programming language treats its functions like any other variable. This allows for functions to take functions as parameters.

An example of which would be:

// Created a const variable which is assigned a function which takes two parameters, a function & a name. We can pass a function as it is treated as a variable.
const printName = function(changeName, name) { console.log(changeName(name));} 

function reverseName (name) { 

    return name.split('').reverse().join('');
}
//Call the function printName, sending the function reverseName function as a parameter. 
printName(reverseName, "Ollie");


Another way of getting the same result would be to call reverseName inside of printName, like such: printName(reverseName("Ollie));.
