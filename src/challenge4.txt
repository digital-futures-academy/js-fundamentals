First class functions occur when a programming language treats its functions like any other variable. This allows for functions to take functions as parameters.

An example of which would be:

// Created a const variable which is assigned a function which takes two parameters, a function & a name. We can pass a function as it is treated as a variable.
const printName = function(changeName, name) { console.log(changeName(name));} 

function reverseName (name) { 

    return name.split('').reverse().join('');
}
//Call the function printName, sending the function reverseName function as a parameter. 
printName(reverseName, "Ollie");


Declaring a function is when you create a function to perform a process when called, calling it is when you use the function.
As shown below:

//Declaring a function

function greetGuest(name) { 
	console.log(`Welcome to the manor ${name}!`);
	}
// The declared function won't actually run untill it is called, like as shown below:

greetGuest("Ollie");

Which will print to the console: "Welcome to the manor Ollie!".
