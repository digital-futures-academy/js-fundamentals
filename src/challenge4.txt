A first class function is a function that is treated like any other variable, 
it can be passed to another function as a parameter and also be returned by
a function then set as the value of a variable.

Example: function hello() {
			return 'Hello!';
		 }

The example is a first class function as it fits the criteria to be 
identified as one.

This concept corresponds to the use of callback functions and higher-order
functions which are signficantly used in JavaScript to perform numerous 
important operations. Additionally, it means that functions have a superb 
amount of flexiblity, capability, and potential.

Example: function hello(getName()) {
			const name = getName();
			console.log(`Hello! ${name}!`);
		 }

getName() is a callback function because it's invoked within the higher-order
function hello. It's higher-order because it takes a function as a parameter.

Declaring a function means to define it. This consists of naming it and
then writing code within it's body that will be executed after it's
called. Calling a function refers to code that is responsible for
executing the contents of the declared function.

The first example is a declared function and on line 18, the getName 
function is called and then assigned to the name variable.
