#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are

A first class function is a function that can be treated like any other value. You can pass them to functions as arguments, return them from functions, and save them in variables.

- how this concept applies in JS.

In javascript functions are first class objects meaning a programmer can take advantage of powerful design patterns such as higher-order functions, partial function application, callbacks, and more.

- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it

A function declaration is when you write the functionâ€™s name, return type, parameters and method body.
Calling a function is executing the code within a function with the given parameters to provide a output.

// Function definition
function speak(string) {
  console.log(string)
}

// function call
speak("Hello")                 

- Bonus: give examples for each explanation
