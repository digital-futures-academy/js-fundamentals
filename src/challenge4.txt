In JavaScript, the term 'first-class' functions refers to paralleled behaviour of functions with other variables. Particularly, JavaScript functions 
are often denoted as first class objects. This means that like other objects, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods;
can be assigned to any other variable; passed as an argument; passed into other functions as parameters; and can be returned by another function.

Declaring a function (1) vs Calling a function (2) - 

Function declarations load prior to code execution. A function declaration does not ask the code inside the function body to run, it simply declares the existence of the function.
Additionally, declared functions are hoisted and so, they are initialized at compile time and available anywhere in your file. On the contrary, function calls execute the function
body. 

Example (1) //

function reminderAlert () {
  console.log("The meeting should be scheduled for tomorrow.")
};

Example (2) //

reminderAlert();
