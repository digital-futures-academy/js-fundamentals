A "first class" function is a feature in programming languages where functions are treated as variables. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. 

JavaScript makes use of first class funtions.
e.g.
Take the function made in challenge 3: 
const greet = (name) => {
    return `Hi, ${name}!`;
}

This function can then be used as a variable. We can then use this function in combination with other functions and pass it as a parameter.

function you(greeting, name) {
    return greeting(name);
}

console.log(you(greet, "Neeko")); # Output: Hello Neeko!



Declaring a function is where you create the method of a function and declare the input parameters and the output. Calling it is where you run said function with your chosen parameters to get an output. 
i.e.
Declaring:
function greet(name) {
    return `Hi, ${name}!`;
}
Calling:
greet("Skadi")
