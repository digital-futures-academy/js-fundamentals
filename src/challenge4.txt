- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation

-first class functions are treated like variables, can be passed as arguments to other 
functions and also returned from a function. They are treated as 'firstclass citizens' 
-This helps us to create call back functions and higher order functions
-The difference is that when you declare a function you are only saying what you want the 
function to do and so it just sits there. Calling a function is telling javascript to run 
the code inside your function
example declaring:                       example calling:
 const welcome = ()=>{                               welcome(); //outputs 'Hello there!'
    console.log('Hello there!');
}
