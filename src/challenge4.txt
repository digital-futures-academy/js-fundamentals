A first class function is a function that is treated like a first class citizen. 

This means it supports:-

Passing the function as an argument to other functions.
Returns the value from the other functions and storing or assigning them into variables.
By declaring the function we can tell the computer about the function name and how to call it.
By calling the function we are telling the computer the run the block of the code and it returns the value.

Eg of Function

function example(){

console.log("Hello Digital Future").
}

Calling the function 

example();
