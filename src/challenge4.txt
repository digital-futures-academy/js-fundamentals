##In a markdown or text file called challenge4.md or challenge4.txt, write an explanation of
##what First Class functions are
##how this concept applies in JS.
##what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
##Bonus: give examples for each explanation

A first Class function is a function that can be treated like other variables, 
i.e. input into other function and assigned as a value to a variable.

Declaring a function is simply writing the mechanical process that the function 
will execute whenever the function is called and giving the function an idenifier
(or name). Note declaring a function will not cause it to run.
		e.g: function greet (name) {
				console.log(`Hi ${name}!);
			};

Calling a function is to simply execute the function with the given input(s).
		e.g: greet(Ed);
			// Output: Hi Ed!
			
In Javascript First Class functions can be:
	1. assigned to a variable
			e.g: const hello = function() {
					console.log('Hello');
				}
				hello();
	
	2. passed as an argument in another function:
			e.g: function myName (input) {
					return 'Shiv';
				}
				function intro (name) {
					console.log('Hello, my name is ' + name + '!');
				}
				intro(myName); 
				//Output: Hello, my name is Shiv!
