First class functions are functions that are treated as variables. 
This means that they can be assigned to other variables or can be used as a variable in other functions. 


A function declaration consist of the name of the function, parameters (if any) in parentheses and the body of the function which includes js statements.
However just declaring function does not do anything. Calling the function will execute all the statments inside the body of the function.

For example,

//A Function declaration
function sayHello(name = "Ed") {
  return "Hi" + name;
}

//Assignment
const greet = sayHello;

//Passing it as an argument to another function
function logHello(func) {
  return console.log(func);
}

//Calling the function
logHello(greet());

This will output: "Hi Ed" to the console.
