In the programming context, being first-class, gives JavaScript functions the ability to be saved in 
variables, passed around as arguments or even returned from other functions. Taking this a step further, 
functions can reside inside objects as one of the properties.

function sayHello() {
   return "Hello, ";
}
function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
  console.log(helloMessage() + name);
}
// Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
