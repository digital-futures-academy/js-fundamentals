First Classs Function :
    when the functions of a programming language are treated like variables are considered as first class functions. For example a function can be assigned as a value to a variable or passed to another function as an argument or can be returned by another function.
    In Js functions are just values like objects.

Declaring a function vs calling it:
     declaring a function is when the function is defined or structured. when we first define a fuction we give it a name, parameters, write some codes inside the function block and return something, but the code is just there doing nothing. 
     calling the function with () at the end of its name is when we tell javascript to run the function we declared. Henc, a function is a block of codes that can be run mutiple times by calling its name.

    Example of declaring a funtion : 
        funtion greet(){
            console.log('Hello')
        }
    
    Example of calling a funtion : 
        greet()
