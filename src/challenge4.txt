1. First-class functions are a concept in computer science and programming languages 
where functions are treated as first-class citizens. 
This means they can be:
    Passed as arguments to other functions.
    Returned as values from other functions.
    Assigned to variables.
    Stored in data structures.



2. In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated just like any other data type.
    In JavaScript, functions can be assigned to variables just like any other value.
    In JavaScript, you can pass functions as arguments to other functions. This allows for the creation of higher-order functions.
    In JavaScript, functions can also return other functions. This is another aspect of higher-order functions. 
    In JavaScript, functions can be stored in arrays, objects, or any other data structure.


3. Declaring a function: This is the process of defining a function. 
When you declare a function, you specify its name, parameters (if any), 
and the code that will be executed when the function is called.
    ex. function greet(name) {
            console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
        }

Calling a function: This is the process of invoking or executing a function. 
When you call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses () 
and provide any required arguments inside the parentheses. 
Calling a function executes the code defined within its body.
    ex. greet('Pedro')
