First-Class Functions:
In programming languages, the concept of first-class functions refers to the ability of functions to be treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be:

1. Assigned to variables: You can assign a function to a variable.

2. Passed as arguments to other functions: You can pass a function as an argument to another function.

3. Returned from other functions: A function can be returned as a value from another function.

4. Stored in data structures: Functions can be stored in data structures like arrays or objects.

In JavaScript:
JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, which means you can do all of the above with functions.

Examples:
1. Assigned to variables:
   const sayHello = function() {
     console.log("Hello!");
   };

2. Passed as arguments to other functions:**
   function greet(greetingFunction) {
     greetingFunction();
   }

   greet(function() {
     console.log("Hola!");
   });

3. Returned from other functions:
   function getGreetingFunction() {
     return function() {
       console.log("Bonjour!");
     };
   }

   const bonjourFunction = getGreetingFunction();
   bonjourFunction();


4. Stored in data structures:
   const functionArray = [
     function() {
       console.log("Good morning!");
     },
     function() {
       console.log("Good afternoon!");
     }
   ];

   functionArray[0]();

Difference between Declaring and Calling a Function:

- Declaring a function: This involves defining the function and its behavior. It's the process of creating a function and specifying what it does.

  function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
  }

- Calling a function: This involves executing the function with specific arguments. It's the process of invoking the function to perform its defined task.

  greet("Alice");

  In this example, declaring the function happens with the `function greet(name) { ... }` syntax, and calling the function occurs with `greet("Alice")`.
