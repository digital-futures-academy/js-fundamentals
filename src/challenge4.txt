1. A first class function is a feature of a programming language where a function can be used in the same way as any other variable.
   It can be assigned values, used as paramaters in other functions and can be used as a return value.
   Example: In C++ a function cannot be used as anything other than a method to do something where as in Javascript a function can be 
	    the method, the arguement and the return value simultaneously.

2. As mentioned in the example above, a Javascript function can be used interchangeably with other variables making its functions first class.
   Example: 
    //Declare our function
    function numberSum(num1, num2)
	{
		return num1 + num2;
	}

    //After the function has been declared we can assign it to a variable
    let add = numberSum(5,10);

    //This same logic apply for passing the function as a parameter or a return value.

3. Declaring a function is the act of programming what the function will do, using numberSum from above we can see that we specify what we want
   our function to do. This is an example of a declaration. Calling a function happens when we need to use the function we have declared ie the 
   let add = numberSum(5,10) we used before. This line calls the function with our provided parameters and assigns add to the sum value.
