A first class function is where a function is created containing a data type, then assigned to a variable.
The variable can then represent the function which can later be invoked. e.g.

function square (x) {
    return x*x ;
}

let times = square

when run the variable 'times' will act as the function above. e.g.

console.log(times(10))
OUTPUT = 100

what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it?

Declaring a function is done by using the key word 1) function followed by the 2)function name, 
after this we have the function 3) parameters aka input inside of the () parentheses then we have
4) a function body inside of {} curly braces. finally 5) a return is added. 

These 5 items collectively are the most common form of function declaration.

Calling a function is different after the function has been created and added to a variable.
we can call the function via the console.log()

Using the example above 

Console.log(times(10))
OUTPUT = 100
