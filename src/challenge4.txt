First class functions are functions that are treated like a first class object, they can be stored in varaibles, returned from other functions
This concept applies in JavaScript as it uses first class functions meaning that higher order functions, partial function applcation and callbacks can all be used.
Declaring a fucntion creates the function itself to be called upon anytime, calling a function is the process of running the function with given parameters to give an output. Example: function greet () {
return console.log("Hi, Ed!")}; is declaring a function and calling it would be simply: greet();
