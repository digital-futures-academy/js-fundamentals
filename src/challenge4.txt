In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation



First Class functions are functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to another function or can be returned as a value from a function.

Declaring a function structures what it will execute, creating a reuseable block of code. Calling a function means executing the specific block of code that was declared when the function was made.

Example: 

//declaring the function multiplyBy
function multiplyBy(factor) {
    return function(num) {       
        return num * factor;
    }
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);

// calling the function
console.log(double(6)); // returns 12
