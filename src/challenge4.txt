A First-class function, is a function that essentially treats functions like a variable.
There are different types of first-class functions.
One being the Higher-order function, in which you can use another function as a parameter.
Another being a callback function. This means you can pass a function, into another function.
Javascript is a language that has first-class functions.
A javascript example of a callback function could be array.map. This is a method, which is technically a function. However you can pass another function into .map!
