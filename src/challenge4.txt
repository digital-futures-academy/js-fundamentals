- what `First Class` functions are

> First class functions are functions that can be treated like a variable and therefore passed into another function as a callback function. (Is an anonymous function a first class function? - I guess not because it's not associated with a variable, but i don't know.)

const square = (x) => {
	return x*x
}

const applySquare = (func, num) => {
	return func(num)
}

applySquare (square, 5)





- how this concept applies in JS.

> We can pass functions into other functions - I suppose it works the same way as in other languages.





- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it

> Declaring a function means creating it so that it's ready to be called. Calling a function means actually using it. So you have to declare a function before you can use it.
