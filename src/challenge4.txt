First class functions are functions that are treated 'fist-class'. Essentially, they can be treated just like any other variable.
First Class functions can pass functions as arguments for other functions:


greetFunc(myNameFunc);

use functions in the return statement:
myAgeFunc() {
 return randNumFunc;
}

as well as assign functions to variables:
let greetFunc = name => `Hello ${name}`;

Declaring a function is different to calling a function
Declaring is assigning and creating the function, creating a definition for it and code to follow through when it is called. Declaring is also where required or optional arguments are created:
let greetFunc = name => {
 return `Hello ${name}`;
}

When calling the function, it runs through the function with any submitted arguments:
greetFunc('Rogan');
// returns "Hello Rogan"
