1. what `First Class` functions are

First class functions are functions that are treated like variables.

2. how this concept applies in JS.

This concept applies to JS as you can store/assign functions in a variable and pass as arguments and return them.

3. what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it

Declaring a function is creating a named function which is called by using its declaration name. E.g. 
function myFavouriteColor(){
    console.log('Yellow')
}
Calling a function means that the function is then called or executed anywhere within the code. E.g.
myFavouriteColor()
