#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of

- what `First Class` functions are

First class functions are functions that are treated like any other variable. For example, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

- how this concept applies in JS.

We can see examples of first class functions in the anonymous functions that can be coded in Javascript.

- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it

declaring a function means that you create the function in your program. This by itself would do nothing until it is called by another bit of coding. 


- Bonus: give examples for each explanation
