- what `First Class` functions are
If functions in a programming language are handled like other variables, it is said that the language has first-class functions. This indicates that the language enables the ability to send functions as arguments to other functions, assign them to varibales or return them from other functions

- how this concept applies in JS.
This behaviour is supported by JavaScript, a programming language.

- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
A function stores data and information similar to a variable wheras calling it only brings back the instructions put in to the function.
