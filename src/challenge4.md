#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation

'First Class' functions are functions which can be treated like variables.

In JS, functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function. First class functions are simply a value and are just another type of object.

Declarinig a function means writing code for a function. Calling function is when you tell the JavaScript interpreter to run the code in your function.
