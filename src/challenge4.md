#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation

FIRST CLASS FUCTIONS- Functions are first class object. Meaning that they can be stored in variables, objects and arrays. Futhermore they can hold their own properties and method. 

APLLICATION- js treats functions as 'first class citizens meaning they are simply a value and another type of object. 

DIFFERENCES- Declaration of a value doesn't ask the function to run but it just delcares its existence. Calling a function you have to write a function name followed by the parenteses. Call executes the statement within the curly braces in the function declaration.
