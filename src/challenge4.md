#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation

First Class functions are functions that are regarded in the same way as any other values. This applies in JavaScript as functions can be passed to other functions as parameters, returned from functions and stored in variables. The difference between declaring and calling a function is that declaring a function involves writing the code for the function to define it, and calling a function involves calling that code to be executed.
