#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
- how this concept applies in JS.
- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it
- Bonus: give examples for each explanation


A programming language has first class functions if the functions are treated as normal data
types. This means that the language supports the ability to pass functions as arguments to other
functions, assign them to variables or return them from other functions. Javascript is a 
programming language that supports this behaviour.

The difference between function declaration an function call is that function declaration
sets up a block of code and a function call is able to invoke that function. an example can be 
shown in the previous challenges where the function declaration a the top creates the greet 
function and the greet() function call below within the console log actually calls it.
