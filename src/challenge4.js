//A first class variable is a function that can be passed as an argument to other functions, 
//returned by another function and assigned as a value to a variable.

//Declaring a function is when you make a function like: 
const foo = function() {
   console.log("foobar");
}
foo();
//But calling a function is when you make the function work: foo(); so it will say foobar in the console.
